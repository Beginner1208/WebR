abstract: 'Purpose: Plant-based eggs have recently been developed to provide consumers with a healthier, animal-friendlier and more sustainable alternative to conventional eggs. The purpose of this paper is to investigate intrinsic and extrinsic attribute preferences for three prototypes of plant-based egg, namely the liquid, powder and egg-shaped. Design/methodology/approach: Nine focus groups in the United Kingdom and nine in Italy were conducted, with a total of 180 participants. A thematic analysis of results was conducted. Findings: In terms of intrinsic product attributes, consumers preferences for colour, shape, taste, ingredients, nutrients, method of production and shelf-life for plant-based eggs were revealed. Regarding the extrinsic attributes, preferences for price, packaging, country of origin and product naming emerged. Similarities and differences between consumers from the two countries are also discussed. Differences in preferences also emerged between vegan and non-vegan consumers. Research limitations/implications: This study adds to the existing knowledge on consumers preferences for new plant-based food alternatives and identifies future quantitative approaches based on qualitative findings. Practical implications: Results from this study can assist plant-based egg manufacturers in improving their products in line with consumers expectations, which may help reducing risk of product failure. Originality/value: This study is the first to investigate consumers preferences, expectations and needs for new food products like plant-based eggs and provides information that can be practically applied by manufacturers, as well as suggestions for future research.'
